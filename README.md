Email Spam Classifier

This project is a simple machine learning model that classifies emails as spam or not spam.
It is implemented using Python and built inside a Jupyter Notebook.

I created this project to understand the basic workflow of a machine learning classification problem, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

How to Run
1. Open Anaconda Prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Start Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
4. Open the file `email_spam_classifier.ipynb`
5. Run the cells one by one

Project Overview
1.The dataset contains email messages labeled as spam or ham.
2.Text data is converted into numerical features.
3.A machine learning model is trained to classify emails.
4.The model predicts whether a given email is spam or not.

Files Used
- `email_spam_classifier.ipynb` – main notebook with code and explanations
- `mail_data.csv` – dataset used for training and testing

Tech Used

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn

Notes

This is a learning-focused project.
It can be improved further by using different models, more data, or better text preprocessing.
